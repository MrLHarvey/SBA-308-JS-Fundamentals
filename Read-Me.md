In this assignment I made it my goal to get a neater and more organized output array of objects by making a GetLearnerData function and running a for loop.

I separated each object and tried to make an array but all I was getting is commented out on line 127.

I found info about jQuery library so I implemented that on line 128 and I believe I got the result I was looking for.
